##How do we take text and then put it into a list so that we can actually loop through and do some analysis on it?

text = """

I was a ghost, I was alone (Hah)
Eoduwojin (Hah) apgilsoge (Ah)
Given the throne I didn't know (Hah) how to believe (Hah)
I was the queen that I'm meant to be (Ah)
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid, kkeuteopsi on stage

I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin'
Like I'm born to be
We're dreamin' hard, we came so far
Now I believe

We're goin' up, up, up
It's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna bе golden
Oh, up, up, up
With our voices
Yeongwonhi kkaеjil su eomneun
Gonna be, gonna be golden
See pop shows near Brooklyn
Get tickets as low as $67

Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin'
Like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fear, no lies
That's who we're born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see

No more hiding, I'll be shining
Like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong
And I know I believe

We're goin' up, up, up
It's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up
With our voices
Yeongwonhi kkaejil su eomneun
Gonna be, gonna be golden

Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining
Like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
Balkge bitnaneun urin
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

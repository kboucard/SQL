#1. Calculate how much is spent per year on the salaries for each department where the total spent on the salaries is at least $300,000. Your results table should include the department name and the total spent on salaries in that department.

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING total_salary >= 300000;

#2. Select all the departments that pay an average of at least $70,000 per year. Your results table should include the department and average salary for that department, and you should rename the average salary column using an alias. 

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING avg_salary >= 70000;

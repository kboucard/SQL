#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about a digital media store.


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers WHERE Country <> "USA" OR "United States" OR "USA";


#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerID = inv.InvoiceID
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';


#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE "Sales % Agent";


#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;


#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;


#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.LastName, cust.FirstName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE "%2009%";


#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';


#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT invl.InvoiceLineID, t.Name
FROM chinook.invoice_items invl
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON invl.TrackID = t.TrackID;


#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT invl.InvoiceLineId, a.name as Artist, t.Name as Track
FROM chinook.Invoice_items invl
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON invl.TrackID = t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.AlbumID = t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists a
ON a.ArtistID = al.ArtistID;


#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS Track, al.Title AS Album_Title, m.Name AS Media_Type, g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t 
JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.AlbumID = al.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.MediaTypeID = t.MediaTypeID
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreID = t.GenreID;


#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.Title, e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent';


#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices i 
ON i.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY round(sum(i.Total), 2) DESC;

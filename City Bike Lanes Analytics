#In this project, I created a table and inserted data for city bike lanes using SQLite Studio. I ran queries with CTEs to answer questions.


#1. List all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. Show the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".

WITH average_sr_cte AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS avg_sr
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street)

SELECT avg_sr, street, 'Safe Lane' AS 'label'
FROM average_sr_cte
WHERE avg_sr >= 4;

For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert Spotify data into. I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


#1. What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability) AS avgdance
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name;

#2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT distinct artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

#3. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC;

#4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT AVG(danceability) AS avg_d
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN
(SELECT track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC 
LIMIT 10);
